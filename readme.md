# Ecko

> Mock any API for testing and development.

## Install

```bash
npm install ecko
```

## TODO

- [ ] Add github workflow to run checks and tests
- [ ] Add docs
- [ ] Add examples
- [ ] Add more tests
- [ ] Consider supporting an "all" request method. This could make response
      frequency unpredictable. Also, you should know the request method for the
      endpoint; why would you need "all?
